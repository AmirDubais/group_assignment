<p>Cardio is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process. "Aerobic" is defined as "relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen", and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. Aerobic exercise is performed by repeating sequences of light-to-moderate intensity activities for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>Flexibility exercises, also called range-of-motion exercises or plain old stretching, keep your muscles elastic and your joints moving freely. Flexibility exercises should feel like “comfortable tension.” You feel only stretching, never pain.</p>

<p>Balance training involves doing exercises that strengthen the muscles that help keep you upright, including your legs and core. These kinds of exercises can improve stability and help prevent falls.</p>
